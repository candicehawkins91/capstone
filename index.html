<div id="P1" class="container">
  <h4> Week 1 - 2 / HTML</h4>
<p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a standard coding language used to structure the content of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more, essentially telling a web browser how to display information on a website by using tags to mark up the text and multimedia content within a document. Read more about what we learned by clicking on HTML below.</p>

<div id="P2" class="container">
  <h4> Week 3 / CSS and Bootstrap</h4>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS Framework that is used for developing responsive website. CSS does not have a grid system. Bootstrap is based on-grid system. Learn more by clicking on CSS below.</p>

  <h4> Week 5 / JavaScript</h4>
<p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

    <h4> Week 6 / JavaScript cont.</h4>
    <p>In Advanced JavaScript, we delve into more sophisticated concepts, building on foundational knowledge. This includes, but is not limited to, mastering comparisons, loops, control structures, and callbacks for efficient coding. We also explore the crucial distinction between value and reference in data handling, as well as advanced DOM manipulation techniques, such as selecting elements, modifying content and styles, and integrating event listeners. Emphasis is placed on adhering to standard indentation and best practices to ensure clean, maintainable, and professional-grade code. See exactly what we learned by clicking cont. below.</p>
